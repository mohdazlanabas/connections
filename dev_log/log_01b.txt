Activity Log > Day 01: Afternoon
================================

**Stripe Payment Integration:**
- Integrated Stripe Checkout for one-time payments (Premium Membership, $9.99).
- Backend endpoint `/api/create-checkout-session` creates a Stripe Checkout session and returns the payment URL.
- Frontend payment page calls this endpoint and redirects users to Stripe for payment.
- Switched from subscription mode to one-time payment mode to resolve Stripe API error.

**Frontend Improvements:**
- Payment page now includes a "Back to Search" button for easy navigation.
- Search page has a "Go Premium" button linking to the payment page.

**Security & GitHub Compliance:**
- Stripe secret key moved from code to `.env` file for security.
- Backend loads environment variables using `github.com/joho/godotenv`.
- `.env` is included in `.gitignore` to prevent secrets from being committed.
- Instructions provided for removing secrets from git history if previously committed.

**Error Handling & User Experience:**
- Handled Stripe errors and browser warnings (e.g., unsupported `<link rel=preload>` and Stripe JS module errors).
- Payment flow tested and confirmed working with Stripe test keys.

**Requirements & Documentation:**
- Updated `requirements.txt` to reflect Go backend dependencies and note frontend dependencies are in `package.json`.

**Next Steps:**
- Optionally handle payment success/cancel on the frontend.
- Consider deploying the app to a cost-effective platform (Railway, Render, Vercel, etc.).
- Continue feature development as needed.
