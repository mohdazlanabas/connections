App Development Log > Day 01: PM
====================================

1. Added 20 purchase cards to search.tsx:
   - Each card uses a unique image from /assets/png/ and displays a price ($100 to $2000).
   - Images were moved from assets/pnglang to frontend/public/assets/png, and filenames were used as card names.

2. Enhanced search.tsx functionality:
   - Implemented a search box that scrolls to the relevant card if the item exists.
   - The "Buy" button on each card now redirects to payment.tsx with the selected item and price as query parameters.
   - The top bar's "Logout" button was changed to a "Home" button linking to home.tsx.

3. Updated payment.tsx:
   - Displays the selected item's image, name, and price when redirected from a card purchase.
   - Payment UI adapts based on whether a specific item is being purchased or a premium subscription is selected.

4. Created home.tsx:
   - Duplicated from index.tsx but removed the Login button for logged-in users.
   - Added a "Search" button to navigate to search.tsx.
   - Added a "Logout" button to return to index.tsx.

5. Navigation improvements:
   - Users can now easily move between Home, Search, and Logout (landing) pages.

6. Codebase maintenance:
   - Counted total lines of code (1,943, excluding .gitignore files).
   - Verified and terminated (if any) running git processes (none found).
