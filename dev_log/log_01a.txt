Day 1 Morning Dev Activity Log
=============================

**Project Overview:**
- The project is a web app for connecting people, allowing users to upload profiles, search for others, message, and arrange video calls. It supports multilingual messaging and privacy features.

**Initial Setup:**
- The project uses a Go backend and a Next.js (TypeScript) frontend.
- The frontend starter page was updated to reflect the app's purpose, with sections for profile upload, search, messaging, video, and calendar.

**Backend:**
- The Go backend (main.go) provides an /api/hello endpoint.
- CORS headers were added to allow the frontend (localhost:3000) to communicate with the backend (localhost:8080).
- To start the backend:
  1. Open a terminal.
  2. Navigate to the backend directory:
     cd backend
  3. Run the server:
     go run main.go

**Frontend:**
- The frontend is a Next.js app located in the frontend directory.
- To start the frontend:
  1. Open a new terminal window/tab.
  2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
     cd frontend
  3. Install dependencies (if not already done):
     npm install
  4. Start the development server:
     npm run dev

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the frontend cannot fetch from the backend, ensure both servers are running and CORS headers are set in the Go backend.
- Visit http://localhost:8080/api/hello to check backend status.
- Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the frontend.
